<h1> Kibo School of Technology Web Programming Project </h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
Climate Change is a real and undeniable threat to our entire civilization. United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 13 calls the world to take an action to combat climate change and its impact before it is too late. Climate change is responsible for increasing the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events including but not limited to heat waves, droughts, floods and this has lead to reduced agricultural production, food insecurity, health risks and increased global emissions.
<p>Everyone has a responsibility and something to contribute to reduces the worsening effects of climate changes and to contribute to achieving the SDG targets.
As a computer science student who has finised a course on web programming, we would like you to design a web application that contributes to the bigger goal of climate actions by solving one of the related causes of climate changes.

<h2> Objectives </h2> 
<h2> Logistical Requirements </h2>
<ul>
  <li> This is a group project and cannot be individually unless in specific circumstances explained to the instructor </li>
  <li>The project must not be done in groups of 2 to 3 members</li>
  <li> We shall have two deadlines for this project </li>
  <ul>
    <li> <b> Tuesday, August 30 at 11:59pm  </b>: Project Proposal is due </li>
    <li> <b> Monday, October 30 at  11:58 pm </b> Final Project is due</li>
  </ul>
  
</ul>

<h3>Technological and Style Requiremennts </h3>
In this project, you are advised to include the following technologies:
<ul>
  <li> <b>Frontend:HTML/CSS   </b>  </li>
   <ul>
     <li> Your application should be user friendly to the domain experts </li>
     <li> You are advised not to use deprecated CSS tags and for the tags used should be semantically coherent </li>
      <li> Include a CSS animation or transition </li>
     <li> Most of the application content should be written in raw HTML and CSS, use of high level libraries is not allowed </li>
  </ul>
   <li> <b> Frontend:Javascript  </b>  </li>
   <ul>
     <li> Use object-oriented javascript with demonstrated use of ES6 classes  </li>
     <Li> Capture user data using <code>forms</code></li>
     <li> Use of global variables like <code> var </code>  should be minimised or not used at all</li>
     <li> Using high level libraries like Jquery or React is not allowed in this project</li>
      <li> You should demonstrate clear understanding of events and clear communication between your classes</li>
  </ul>
   <li> <b> Backend  </b>  </li>
   <ul>
     <li> We highly reccomend using Node library for your backend </li>
     <li> Efficient use of HTTP methods like <code>GET</code> and <code>POST</code> is expected instead of saving data directly to the file system </li>
       <li> Including  databases will be an added advantage </li>
  </ul>
</ul>



<h2>Publishing your site </h2>
<p> You may use any platform for deploying your website, but it should be accessible both on mobile and desktop devices </p>
<p> We reccomend using Heroku <a href = "https://www.heroku.com/">Visit the webiste for more details</a> </p>

<h2> Extra Credits  </h2>
<ul>
  <li>We shall award credit for the practically oriented solution that can directly be deployed. </li>
   <li>EXtra credit will also be awarding for a visually appealing website.</li>
   <li>Clean and consistent written code will also be rewarded.</li>
  
  </ul>
