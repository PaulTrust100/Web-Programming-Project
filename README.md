<h1> Kibo School of Technology Web Programming Project </h1>
<h2>Summary and Objectives </h2>
<p>This project is web programming project that will require you to design an application using the the technologies we have studied over the last quarter. Since the announcement of the first case of Covid-19, there was an exponential growth in the number of cases to millions of people killing many people in the world. This forced the world to change in the way they live with an adoption of remote working and studying because people could not be in large groups. As of May 2022, there seems to be light in the tunnel with reduction in the hospitalisation and death numbers due to the virus. There were many technologies that were adopted and also created to react to this change. </p>
<p> You are required to design a web aplication that is aimed to solve society problems that either were caused by the pandemic or are the effects of the pandemic. The project should be aimed at </p>
  
<h2> Logistical Requirements </h2>
<ul>
  <li> You may decide to work as an individual on this project or in a group of not more than 3 students  </li>
  <li>The project must not be done in groups of 2 to 3 members</li>
  <li> We shall have two deadlines for this project </li>
  <ul>
    <li> <b> Tuesday, August 30 at 11:59pm  </b>: Project Proposal is due </li>
    <li> <b> Monday, October 30 at  11:58 pm </b> Final Project is due</li>
  </ul>
  
</ul>

<h3>Technological and Style Requiremennts </h3>
In this project, you are advised to include the following technologies:
<ul>
  <li> <b>Frontend:HTML/CSS   </b>  </li>

     <li> You are advised not to use deprecated CSS tags and for the tags used should be semantically coherent </li>
      <li> Include a CSS animation or transition </li>
     <li> Most of the application content should be written in raw HTML and CSS, use of high level libraries is not allowed </li>
  </ul>
   <li> <b> Frontend:Javascript  </b>  </li>
   <ul>
     <li> Use object-oriented javascript with demonstrated use of ES6 classes  </li>
     <Li> Capture user data using <code>forms</code></li>
     <li> Use of global variables like <code> var </code>  should be minimised or not used at all</li>
     <li> Using high level libraries like Jquery or React is not allowed in this project</li>
      <li> You should demonstrate clear understanding of events and clear communication between your classes</li>
  </ul>
   <li> <b> Backend  </b>  </li>
   <ul>
     <li> We highly reccomend using Node library for your backend </li>
     <li> Efficient use of HTTP methods like <code>GET</code> and <code>POST</code> is expected instead of saving data directly to the file system </li>
       <li> Including  databases will be an added advantage </li>
  </ul>
</ul>



<h2>Publishing your site </h2>
<p> You may use any platform for deploying your website, but it should be accessible both on mobile and desktop devices </p>
<p> We reccomend using Heroku <a href = "https://www.heroku.com/">Visit the webiste for more details</a> </p>

<h2> Style Points</h2>

<h2> Extra Credits  </h2>
<ul>
  <li>We shall award credit for the practically oriented solution that can directly be deployed. </li>
   <li>EXtra credit will also be awarding for a visually appealing website.</li>
   <li>Clean and consistent written code will also be rewarded.</li>
